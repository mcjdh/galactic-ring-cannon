# Achievement Balance Update - 2025-11-19 (Part 3)

## Overview
Final adjustment to the Cybernetic Berserker unlock requirement based on feedback that the low-health survival challenge was too punishing.

## Changes

### Cybernetic Berserker (Edge Walker)
- **Health Threshold**: Increased from **<30%** to **<50%**.
- **Duration**: Kept at **45 seconds**.

This change makes the "Edge Walker" achievement significantly more accessible. Players now only need to maintain half health rather than critical health, allowing for a safer buffer against accidental death while still requiring deliberate play.

## Summary
The achievement system is now fully rebalanced for the v1.1 release.
