# Achievement Balance Update - 2025-11-19 (Part 2)

## Overview
Further refined achievement balance based on playtesting feedback. Reverted some changes that were too harsh and removed deprecated achievements.

## Changes

### Removed Deprecated Achievements
The following achievements were part of a legacy kill streak system that is no longer active in the achievement tracking logic:
- **On Fire!** (Reach 25 kill streak)
- **Unstoppable Force** (Reach 50 kill streak)
- **Godlike!** (Reach 100 kill streak)
- **Immortal** (Reach 250 kill streak)

*Note: The "Kill Streak" achievement (50 kills in 10 seconds) remains active as it uses a different tracking mechanism.*

### Reverted/Adjusted Requirements
- **Nexus Architect (Orbital Master)**: Reverted from **8** back to **5** orbitals. 8 was deemed too difficult given the drop rates.
- **Cybernetic Berserker (Edge Walker)**: Reverted from **60s** back to **45s** at <30% HP. 60s was too punishing for a "low health" survival challenge.

## Summary
These adjustments ensure that all listed achievements are actually obtainable and that the difficulty curve for character unlocks is challenging but fair.
