## 🎓 STRATEGY TIPS

### Character-Specific Strategies

**Aegis Vanguard:**
1. Play aggressively - your tankiness allows risky XP collection
2. Prioritize Attack Speed to offset base penalty
3. Stack defensive upgrades early (Health, Regen, Damage Reduction)
4. Take Orbital Attacks for passive damage while dodging

**Nova Corsair:**
1. Master dodge timing - your survival depends on it!
2. Dive in → burst damage → dodge out (hit-and-run)
3. Stack Lifesteal - more damage = more healing
4. Use Nova Knockback when surrounded
5. Stay close to enemies for maximum shotgun damage

**Stormcaller Adept:**
1. Kite enemies into clusters for chain reactions
2. Stack Chain Lightning upgrades (multiplies with built-in chains!)
3. Use Storm Surge when maximum enemies are grouped
4. Prioritize Attack Speed for continuous chain procs
5. Position to funnel enemies into tight corridors

### Universal Tips
- **Prioritize XP magnet** early for safer collection
- **Balance offense and defense** - pure damage builds are risky
- **Save dodge for emergencies** - don't waste the cooldown
- **Learn enemy patterns** - each type has predictable behavior
- **Boss phases change at 70%, 40%, 15% health** - prepare for new attacks
