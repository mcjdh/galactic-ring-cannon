# Tuning V5 Notes: Refined Early Game

## Problem
User reported that V4 (Double XP for 60s) was "a bit much", leading to Level 20-25 in 1 minute.
However, the "first couple levels" felt good.
User also noted the "first 20 seconds of enemies is a bit much".

## Changes

### 1. Targeted Early Boost (Supply)
*   **Duration**: Reduced from 60s to **30s**.
    *   *Effect*: The boost now only helps you get your first ~5-7 levels (the "RNG phase") and then fades out before you can snowball into the mid-20s.
*   **Multiplier**: Reduced from 2.0x to **1.5x**.
    *   *Effect*: Still a significant bonus (50% more XP), but less extreme than double XP.

### 2. Initial XP Adjustment (Demand)
*   **Initial XP to Level**: Increased slightly from 45 to **50**.
    *   *Effect*: Balances the removal of the massive boost. Level 2 is still very fast (5-6 kills), but not instant.

### 3. Gentler Start (Supply)
*   **Early Game Spawn Multiplier**: Reduced from 1.15x to **0.9x**.
    *   *Effect*: The game starts with slightly *fewer* enemies than the base rate for the first 48s, ramping up gently. This addresses the "first 20 seconds is a bit much" feedback.

## Expected Outcome
*   **Level 5 Timing**: ~15-22 seconds (Fast start).
*   **Level 10 Timing**: ~60-90 seconds (Stabilized).
*   **Level 20 Timing**: Not reached in the first 2 minutes (Preventing the snowball).
*   **Feel**: A quick burst of levels to get your build started, followed by a smooth transition into the normal game pace, without being overwhelmed by mobs instantly.
