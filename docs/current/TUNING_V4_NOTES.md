# Tuning V4 Notes: Early Game Buff

## Problem
User reported that while the overall balance is better (Level 4 at 1 minute), the early game feels too slow, making it hard to get a build online due to RNG.

## Changes

### 1. Faster First Levels (Demand)
*   **Initial XP to Level**: Reduced from 80 to 45.
    *   *Effect*: Level 1->2 is almost instant (requires ~4-5 kills).

### 2. Stronger Early XP Boost (Supply)
*   **Early XP Boost Multiplier**: Increased from 1.2x to 2.0x.
    *   *Effect*: For the first 60 seconds, all XP orbs are worth double. This accelerates the first 5-10 levels significantly without affecting the mid-game curve.

### 3. More Early Targets (Supply)
*   **Early Game Spawn Multiplier**: Increased from 1.0x to 1.15x.
    *   *Effect*: Slightly more enemies in the first 48 seconds to ensure there's enough XP available to capitalize on the boost.

## Expected Outcome
*   **Level 5 Timing**: Should now be reachable in ~15-25 seconds (down from ~60s).
*   **Level 10 Timing**: Should be reachable in ~45-60 seconds.
*   **Mid-Game**: Remains stable as the boost wears off at 60s and the geometric scaling kicks in.
