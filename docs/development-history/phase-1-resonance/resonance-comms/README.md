# Resonance Communications

This folder contains all inter-agent communication files, analysis reports, optimization notes, and coordination documents created during the collaborative development of the Galactic Ring Cannon game.

## ðŸŒŸ **Quick Reference**
**âš¡ For essential patterns and knowledge, see [`key-code-patterns.md`](../key-code-patterns.md) in the main directory!**

## Purpose

This space is dedicated to:
- Agent-to-agent communication and coordination
- Optimization session notes and reports  
- Architecture analysis and migration guides
- Performance analysis and cleanup reports
- Multi-agent collaboration documentation

## Organization

Files are organized by communication type and session, including:
- **Optimization Reports**: Various optimization session summaries and performance analyses
- **Refactoring Reports**: Component-specific refactoring documentation (Enemy, Player, GameManager, etc.)
- **Architecture Guides**: Migration and component architecture analysis
- **Resonant Communications**: Direct agent-to-agent coordination messages and notes
- **Cleanup Reports**: Code cleanup and over-engineering reduction documentation

## Note

These files are kept separate from the main codebase to maintain clean separation between actual game code and development coordination materials. They serve as a historical record of the collaborative development process and can be referenced for future optimization work.
