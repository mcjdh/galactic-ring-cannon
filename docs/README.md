## Key Concepts

### Component-Based Architecture

The codebase uses a **component-based architecture** where complex entities (Player, Enemy) are built from smaller, focused components:

```javascript
class Player {
  constructor(x, y) {
    this.stats = new PlayerStats(this);         // Health, XP, level
    this.movement = new PlayerMovement(this);   // Movement & input
    this.combat = new PlayerCombat(this);       // Attacks & projectiles
    this.abilities = new PlayerAbilities(this); // Dodge & abilities
    this.renderer = new PlayerRenderer(this);   // Rendering
  }
}
```

See [current/KEY_CODE_PATTERNS.md](current/KEY_CODE_PATTERNS.md) for details.

### Global Namespace Pattern

All classes are organized under `window.Game` for clean global access:

```javascript
window.Game.Player
window.Game.Enemy
window.Game.GameEngine
window.Game.MathUtils
```

See [current/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](current/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for details.

### Single Source of Truth (GameState)

All game state is centralized in `GameState` to prevent sync issues:

```javascript
state.runtime      // game time, FPS, pause state
state.player       // player stats and position
state.progression  // kills, XP, damage
state.combo        // combo system
state.meta         // achievements, stars
```

See [current/GAMESTATE_ARCHITECTURE.md](current/GAMESTATE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

## Common Tasks

### Understanding Recent Changes

1. Check [updates/v1.0.9-balance-and-fixes/](updates/v1.0.9-balance-and-fixes/) for latest update documentation
2. Review [updates/v1.0.9-balance-and-fixes/ALL_CHANGES_FINAL.md](updates/v1.0.9-balance-and-fixes/ALL_CHANGES_FINAL.md) for complete change list
3. See specific fix documentation for detailed explanations

### Understanding a Class

1. Check [current/API_DOCUMENTATION.md](current/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) for the class reference
2. Look at the actual file in `src/` directory
3. Review [current/KEY_CODE_PATTERNS.md](current/KEY_CODE_PATTERNS.md) for architectural patterns

### Adding a New Feature

1. Review [current/KEY_CODE_PATTERNS.md](current/KEY_CODE_PATTERNS.md) for established patterns
2. Check [current/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](current/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for where to place new files
3. Follow component-based architecture principles
4. Update [current/API_DOCUMENTATION.md](current/API_DOCUMENTATION.md) if adding public APIs

### Understanding a Past Decision

1. Check [development-history/phase-2-integration/CODEBASE_STATUS.md](development-history/phase-2-integration/CODEBASE_STATUS.md) for recent status
2. Search [development-history/](development-history/) for relevant context
3. Look for migration notes in [current/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](current/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)

### Deploying the Game

## Documentation Maintenance

### Keeping Docs Current

When making significant code changes:

1. **Update API docs** if public APIs change
2. **Update patterns** if introducing new architectural patterns
3. **Don't modify historical docs** - they're snapshots of development process
4. **Add to planning docs** if planning future work

### Documentation Status

- ✅ **current/**: Actively maintained, reflects codebase as of October 2025
- 📚 **development-history/**: Preserved as-is, historical record
- 📝 **planning/**: Updated as plans change
- 🗄️ **archive/**: Not actively maintained

---

## For Future AI Models

If you're an AI model working on this codebase:

1. **Start with `current/` documentation** - this reflects the actual codebase
2. **Use `development-history/` for context** - understand why decisions were made
3. **Don't treat historical docs as current** - they document the development journey
4. **Reference `KEY_CODE_PATTERNS.md`** - follow established architectural patterns
5. **Update `current/` docs** when making changes - keep them synchronized with code

The documentation reorganization (October 2025) was specifically done to prevent confusion between current reference material and historical development notes.
